# Project 2 - Novae
This repository contains the project 2 of **EPFL CS-433 Machine Learning**. 

**Team name**: Novae

**Team member**: G. Orsi, V. Rossi, C. Tsai


## Introduction
Because of the large amount of data we needed to process and store, our codes were executed on Google Colab. Here we provide the Python notebooks as our source codes.
## Pre-trained models
Here's the link to our models: [Doc2Vec model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MzmyGhVXI7VYPKLMZVUjXkObASHT3Zeh?usp=sharing), OTHER?

## How to execute
### Preprocessing
1. Query the training set with `feature-selection.ipynb`.
2. Train the Doc2Vec model and transform patent claims into vectors using `claim2vec.ipynb`.
### Predicting
TBD
